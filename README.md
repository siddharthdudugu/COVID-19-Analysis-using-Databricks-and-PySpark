4. Data Cleaning & Pre-processing
During the data exploration phase, it was discovered that all the categorical columns were represented as numerical values. The dataset's author used integers '97', '98', and '99' to indicate missing values, which affected attributes such as INTUBED (whether the patient was intubed or not), PREGNANT (whether the patient was pregnant or not), and ICU (whether the patient was admitted to the ICU or not). Furthermore, the 'DATE_DIED' attribute had values representing patients who were still alive, indicated by date values '9999-99-99'. To handle missing information, the following steps were taken:
●	Replaced missing values in 'PREGNANT' attribute with '2', representing 'no', when the patient's sex was male.
●	Dropped columns 'ICU' and 'INTUBED'.
●	Dropped remaining missing values in other attributes except for the 'DATE_DIED' attribute.
●	Created a new attribute representing whether the patient is alive or not, with values '2' and '1', respectively.

7. COVID-19 Predictive Modeling using PySpark
In the predictive modeling task, we followed a systematic approach to build a model that could accurately predict COVID-19 mortality rates. The steps involved in this process are as follows:
●	Feature Selection: We carefully selected a set of features that we believed would be informative in predicting COVID-19 mortality rates. These features included 'AGE', 'PATIENT_TYPE', 'PNEUMONIA', 'MEDICAL_UNIT', and 'HIPERTENSION'. By considering these specific attributes, we aimed to capture important patient characteristics and medical conditions that could contribute to the prediction.
●	Data Transformation: To prepare the data for modeling, we utilized a VectorAssembler to combine the selected features into a single vector column. This transformation allowed us to create a unified representation of the features, enabling the model to efficiently process and analyze the data.
●	Data Splitting: In order to evaluate the performance of the model, we divided the data into training and test sets. We allocated 80% of the data for training the model and kept the remaining 20% for testing its accuracy. By using a random seed of 42, we ensured that the split was consistent for reproducibility.
●	Model Training: We trained a Logistic Regression model on the training set. Logistic Regression is a popular classification algorithm that is well-suited for predicting binary outcomes, making it suitable for our task of predicting COVID-19 mortality. The model learned from the training data and identified patterns and relationships between the selected features and the target variable.
●	Model Evaluation: To assess the accuracy of our model, we evaluated its performance on the test set. We compared the model's predictions against the actual outcomes in the 'DIED_COL' column. The accuracy of the model on the test set was found to be 93%, indicating that it was able to accurately classify high-risk COVID-19 patients.
●	Prediction Display: To gain insights into the model's predictions, we displayed the target column 'DIED_COL' and the corresponding 'prediction' column for the top 20 rows. This allowed us to visually compare the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes, providing a clear understanding of how well the model performed on individual instances.
By following these steps, we were able to build and evaluate a predictive model for COVID-19 mortality rates. The model demonstrated a high accuracy level, suggesting its potential usefulness in identifying high-risk patients. These findings can aid healthcare authorities in efficiently allocating resources and providing appropriate care to those in need.

8. Model Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the predictive model, several techniques were employed, including:
●	To evaluate the performance of our predictive model, we employed several techniques that allowed us to gain insights into its effectiveness in predicting COVID-19 mortality rates. These techniques provided us with a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance and helped us make informed decisions based on the results.
●	First and foremost, we calculated the accuracy of the model. Accuracy represents the overall correctness of the predictions made by the model. By comparing the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes, we were able to determine the percentage of correct predictions. This metric provided us with a general measure of the model's performance and gave us an idea of its reliability.
●	In addition to accuracy, we constructed a confusion matrix to further analyze the model's predictions. The confusion matrix allowed us to examine the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives generated by the model. This analysis provided us with a more detailed understanding of the model's performance, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses in terms of correctly identifying COVID-19 mortality cases.
●	Furthermore, we utilized evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's performance. Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases among all predicted positive cases, while recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases among all actual positive cases. The F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric, providing a balanced evaluation of the model's performance. By considering these metrics, we were able to gain insights into the model's ability to correctly classify high-risk COVID-19 patients.
●	To enhance the visualization of the confusion matrix, we employed a heatmap. The heatmap visually represented the distribution of correct and incorrect predictions, allowing us to identify patterns and discrepancies in the model's performance. This visualization technique enabled us to quickly identify areas where the model excelled and areas that required improvement, facilitating our decision-making process and future model iterations. 
 
By employing these evaluation techniques, including accuracy, confusion matrix, evaluation metrics, and heatmap visualization, we obtained a comprehensive understanding of the predictive model's performance. This information empowered us to make informed decisions, assess the model's effectiveness, and identify areas for improvement. Ultimately, these evaluation techniques played a vital role in ensuring the reliability and usefulness of our predictive model in predicting COVID-19 mortality rates.
